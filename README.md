# The Knight's Wrath aka. Project Domino (demo)
- The Knight's Wrath is a third person video game that is being created in Unreal Engine 5. The game theme is horror-centric action-adventure game which allows the player to explore and combat. One of the main focuses of Project Domino developers is to maintain the art style which comes from PlayStation 1 era from late 90’s. The game’s theme is inspired by dark medieval/dark fantasy combined with horror elements.
- As part of the design of the game, the player will follow a storyline which gives the user the ability to explore, interact with some of the elements they encounter during their exploration, keep track of their health and stamina, engage in combats with patrolling enemies, and pickup items and keep track of them using an inventory system. The game has two main characters.
- The main goal of our team is to develop a game which runs on Windows systems with minimum requirements, and the graphical design of PS1 era that is mentioned earlier can help to achieve this goal. The game is designed and developed using the combination of Unreal Engine 5, Blueprints and C++.
